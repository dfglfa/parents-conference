You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then, run the commands

```
# Copy app config from template
cp code/config.php_TEMPLATE code/config.php

# Create (first time only) and run docker containers
cd Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

You can then visit your reunion instance at http://localhost

The code is mounted into the php-fpm docker container, so all code changes are reflected immediately.

To begin, login as admin/admin and start by importing student and teacher data in the "Administration" section. Use the files templates/students.csv and templates/teachers.csv for some initial data.
All users have the password "password". There are three students by the name of "MÃ¼ller" with which you can explore the account connection feature for siblings.

Create an Elternsprechtag in the Administration panel.

Login as students/teachers to explore the booking process.

All email will be sent to a "mailcatcher" instance that is running at http://localhost:1080

# Activating LDAP in the docker setup

First, set the config variable `$LDAP_ENABLED` to `true` in the config.php.

Generate a users LDIF file with the script in `utils/generate_users.py`, which will generate three files:

- students.csv
- teachers.csv
- users.ldif

The latter can then be added the ldap docker container via

```
ldapadd -h localhost:1389 -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org" -W -f users.ldif
```

using the admin password `adminpassword`.
